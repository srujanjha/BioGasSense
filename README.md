# BioGasSense
IoT Project

The project is based on the concept of Internet of Things, which involves connecting devices and the acquisition of data internally to simplify manual work. The concept is implemented for remote monitoring of the various parameters, which in this case is the BioGas Reactor. The system that has been designed automates the entire process bringing in human presence only where necessary, through an electronic Arduino module which is connected to the various sensors and itâ€™s data is transmitted through an Ethernet cable or WiFi Module to the Cloud which in turn is connected to a number of peripherals with the data being transmitted to the authorities in charge for instant reaction.
